Landing page:
I crafted a captivating landing page, focusing on the core principles of web development - HTML, CSS, and even a sprinkle of JavaScript.👩🏻‍💻
This opportunity has not only enhanced my technical skills but also reinforced my passion for creating impactful web solutions.💻✨

To-Do List:
I built a To-Do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.🎯
👩🏻‍💻The application allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. This project helped me to improve my front-end development skills and my understanding of user interaction.👩🏻‍💻
💻 By building a To-Do list application, interns can learn how to create user interfaces, how to store and manipulate data, and how to respond to user interactions.💻
